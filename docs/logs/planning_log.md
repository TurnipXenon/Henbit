# Planning log
Put all planning logs here. Planning is laying out what to do. Scheduling is estimating effort and deadlines
for tasks made in planning.

Writing out `docs/projects/henbit_organization.md`...

Huh, I don't really know how to write tasks fast in README. I'm debating on whether I should
just utilize making cards in Projects, and then writing them down here? The advantage of doing that is
that I can easily add details in there that may not be necessary here. I'll do that workflow:
Add card in project board -> Copy the title here.
