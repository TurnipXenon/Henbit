# The Beginning 👀

I don't really know what I'm doing, but I want to make this project structured
and transparent. So, I'm writing this log of my current thoughts as I go, and
see how it evolves over time.

I did not get to document my earlier attempts but from what I remember it was
something like:
- Okay, let's make Github Projects! Let's automate it and hope that it works
as intended. I haven't really cleaned up Github Projects, and I think I need
to read more about how other people use it for.
- Signed up for the Beta program for Github Projects, hope we get in. Putting
the date here to see how many days I'll be waiting to get in. **[2021-10-12]**

So, where am I at? I'm currently making pull request templates. I now have the
pull request template, I just have to document how to use the extra templates
for myself in the future if we ever need it.
