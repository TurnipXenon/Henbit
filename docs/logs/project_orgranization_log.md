# The Beginning 👀

I don't really know what I'm doing, but I want to make this project structured
and transparent. So, I'm writing this log of my current thoughts as I go, and
see how it evolves over time.

I did not get to document my earlier attempts but from what I remember it was
something like:
- Okay, let's make Github Projects! Let's automate it and hope that it works
as intended. I haven't really cleaned up Github Projects, and I think I need
to read more about how other people use it for.
- Signed up for the Beta program for Github Projects, hope we get in. Putting
the date here to see how many days I'll be waiting to get in. *2021-10-12*

So, where am I at? I'm currently making pull request templates. I now have the
pull request template, I just have to document how to use the extra templates
for myself in the future if we ever need it.

Issue template time!

We have these two helpful links:
- https://www.backhub.co/blog/best-practices-for-using-github-issues
- https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository

Issue templates seem straightforward. I think I should not be thinking about
how issues should look like since this project is not open to the community, yet.
Issues are fine to be a few liners, and keep the details in the PRs they are 
attached to.
