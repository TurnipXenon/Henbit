# Overview
We just want Henbit to work. Most of the work here is in the documentation, project planning,
scheduling, and making the Henbit repository a great place to add stuff going forward.

We have three goals for this project:
- Make Henbit work
- Get hands-on experience of setting up a nice repository from the ground-up
- Learning how to write down how we learn

# Scope
Just make Henbit work! We don't want the following in our project board:
- **Refactoring code to be nicer.** Minimize the urge to do that. We'll do that in our next project board.
- **Adding new application features.** We want that on our future project board.
- **Adding new user quality-of-life features.** Things that don't go through documentation,
project planning, and scheduling to improve the outside user experience should be deferred to the
next project board.

# Current state
It's currently not working since I ripped out all the bloat plugins and libraries. The working version is
at (todo(turnipxenon): reference hide/android_v2 branch here). Documentation is all over the place — from random 
Google Docs in different accounts to random messages in Discord.

<!-- todo(turnipxenon): make sequence diagram here -->

# Goal state
Other than just making it plain work. We want to have documentation for everything that we currently have,
and a log about how we did things and the resources we had to achieve those changes.

# Tasks


# Open
- Do we put refactor from Hide to Henbit here?
