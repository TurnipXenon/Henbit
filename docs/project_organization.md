Project organization contains my rules that I hope to stick to in the long run.

# Pull requests

## How to make default PRs
The default PR is currently found at `docs/pull_request_template.md`. Just change
it and watch the magic happen. ✨✨✨

## Extra PR templates
Add the extra PR templates inside `docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE`. To make a PR using
those templates, use the query pattern:
```
https://github.com/TurnipXenon/Henbit/compare/main...<my_branch>?quick_pull=1&template=<pull_request_template.md>
```
Replace `<my_branch>` with the name of your branch, and `<pull_request_template.md>` with
the pull request template that you made.
